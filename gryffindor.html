        <p>As it is recommended that everyone remain at home and limit their contact with others to reduce exposure to the disease, here are some indoor challenges people are trying to pass the time!</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Exploding Snap Architecture: build the highest card tower you can before it explodes! Popular variant: build to create the biggest possible explosion</li>
          <li>Leviosa Races: Trapped in the house with a significant other? No problem! Each choose a mid-size object (a hat, ball, pet, child, etc.) and see who can complete three laps around the house the fastest without dropping it!</li>
          <li>Pep Up Your Step: Got a favorite dance? Take a Pepper-Up Potion and see how you can spice it up!</li>

              <td>A strong athlete and Quidditch fanatic in a time when women were not allowed on House teams, Fa carried out a Slytherin-worthy deception by masquerading as a boy so as to be allowed to try out! Making the team in her first year, Fa flew the team to victory and was lauded by all lions until a bludger to the back put her in the Infirmiry, upon which her gender was discovered and she was booted from the team. So pitiful was the team without her that the Headmaster and Deputy of the time (both Gryffindor alumni and stunch Quidditch enthusiasts) gathered the votes needed to overturn the rule! Having proved that women could play as well as any man, Fa remains the idol of any Holyhead Harpy fan for her actions that made the team possible.</td>
